How to update the favicon after you've got the site set-up and running locally.

## Create the icon

I use photoshop, but you can really use anything. I usually create this as a 700px by 700px square jpg or png.

## Generate the favicon

Go to [favicon-generator.org](https://www.favicon-generator.org/) and upload your newly created icon. If you don't want your favicon in the library make sure to uncheck the *Include your favicon.ico in the public gallery.* checkbox.

## Download favicon

Click on the *Download the generated favicon* link. You can ignore the rest of the code bit, it's already in place.

## Add to site

Unzip the icons. Copy all the contents to `src/images/icons` and overwrite all when prompted.
